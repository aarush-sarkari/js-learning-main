// IMMEEDIATELY INVOKE FUNCTION EXPRESSION (IIFE)
// An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.
// It is a design pattern which is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function and contains two major parts.
// The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator (). 
// This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.
// The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression () through which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.


(function hello(name){
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`)
}("aarush")) ;
 

(name =>{
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`)
})("aarush") ;
